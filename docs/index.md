Welcome to the Colonel By Coding Club docs. This website is intended to help anyone get involved into competitive programming. It features descriptions and example code, useful videos and other resources and many practice problems.
 
## Getting Started
 
Competitive programming is very fun and not hard at all to get into. It gives a great feeling of satisfaction upon answering a question correctly. If you find it interesting and put in the work, you can easily be top level competitors. 

### Choosing a Language
 
We all use both C++ and Python when solving problems. The two languages we would most recommend are C++ and Java. C++ has much less verbose syntax and is thus faster to write in most cases.
 
### Never Stop Learning
This is the order in which we learned concepts, but there is no perfect order to follow, however some topics are much easier when you know others. The most important thing to remember when learning these concepts is to take time and practice.
TODO|
---|
Implementation (become familiar and comfortable with a language)|
[Recursion](recursion)|
[Graph theory and BFS/DFS](graph)|
[Dynamic Programming](dp)|
Greedy algorithms|
[Single Source Shortest Path](graph) - Dijkstra’s and Bellman-Ford|
Learn about different [containers](stl) learn standard libraries, they’re very powerful|
Minimum Spanning Trees|
Data Structures (Binary Indexed Tree, Segment Tree, Binary Search Tree)|
 
**Concepts can take several days or weeks to fully understand, keep working at them!**
